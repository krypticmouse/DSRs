DSRs is a rewrite of the DSPy framework, built from the ground up in Rust for programming robust, LM-powered applications. By leveraging Rust’s type system, memory safety, and concurrency, DSRs offers a more efficient and reliable foundation for language model workflows.

- **Not just a port:** DSRs reimagines DSPy’s abstractions with Rust’s strengths in mind.
- **Modern Rust API:** Take advantage of Rust’s ecosystem, async support, and strong typing.
- **Core features:** Includes signatures, modules, adapters, etc.
- **Easy to get started:** Install via Cargo, and follow the [Quickstart](docs/getting-started/quickstart) to build your first pipeline in minutes.

> _Inspired by the original [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) framework, DSRs brings LM application development to the Rust community._
