# Implementation Tracker

## Current State
- **Slice**: 5 (V5 optimizer interface)
- **Phase**: Plan
- **Primary kickoff doc**: `docs/plans/modules/phase_4_5_cleanup_kickoff.md`
- **Current deferred-ledger source**: `docs/plans/modules/slices_closure_audit.md`
- **Roadmap**: V5 (optimizer interface) → V6 (dynamic graph) → Kill Pass (legacy deletion)
- **Roadmap rationale**: 4.5-lite prerequisites are complete; remaining execution follows breadboard V5→V6, then legacy deletion sweep.

## Active Subagents
| ID | Purpose | Slice | Phase | Status | Notes |
|----|---------|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| `019c453b-9133-7b23-bb4d-6cb001dea031` | Stupidly implementable plan for Slice 5 (optimizer interface) | 5 | Plan | In progress | Drafting `slice_5.md` with verified symbols, concrete signatures, and V5-only sequencing |

| `019c43b4-cc15-7141-8644-166205cf4a26` | Plan refinery against ground truth for Slice 2 | 2 | Plan Refinery | Completed; produced `slice_2_refinery.md`, updated `slice_2.md`, and surfaced one arbitration item now resolved (`ChainOfThoughtBuilder` delegates full `PredictBuilder` DSL; wrappers remain `Deref`-only) |
| `019c43be-fa6e-7080-97d8-08ceaab8c4db` | Implement Slice 2 plan in code/tests | 2 | Implement | Partial; macro conflicts required manual completion and additional adapter/schema adjustments to align flattened augmentation fields |
| `019c43e9-045c-7693-bc73-2e13531c3b28` | Adversarial review against ground truth | 2 | Adversarial Review | Completed; produced `slice_2_review.md` with three findings (missing Facet on `ChainOfThought`, untyped `Module::forward` mismatch against design example, and empty legacy `parameters()` visibility) |
| `019c4412-6e17-7fb2-8abf-321f4e4d415e` | Apply agreed Slice 2 arbitration fix (legacy optimizer visibility) | 2 | Arbitrate | Completed; updated `ChainOfThought::parameters()` to expose `predictor` and added regression test `chain_of_thought_parameters_expose_predictor_for_legacy_optimizers` |
| `019c4415-5851-70e3-8e74-bc49d59c9f86` | Research brief for Slice 3 (module authoring) | 3 | Research | Failed; no output | Subagent rejected by prompt-policy guard before execution; replacing with narrower prompt |

| `019c441e-01f4-75f1-9905-3da3bf970159` | Stupidly implementable plan for Slice 3 (module authoring) | 3 | Plan | Completed; produced `slice_3.md` with sequencing/tests for V3 migration | Initial review found directional correctness but concrete API/name mismatches requiring refinery correction |
| `019c441f-07b6-7d00-a7cd-7c47d3714b5b` | Plan refinery against ground truth for Slice 3 | 3 | Plan Refinery | Completed; produced `slice_3_refinery.md` and updated `slice_3.md` with coverage notes, including explicit test comprehensiveness check | No unresolved `NEEDS ARBITRATION` markers remained; final arbitration moved to direct code-grounded implementation due stale/non-existent API names still present in the plan text |
| `019c4439-b9ac-7721-885e-6147e96f8d40` | Adversarial review against ground truth for Slice 3 | 3 | Adversarial Review | Completed; produced `slice_3_review.md` with 2 high, 2 medium, 1 low finding | Findings reviewed during Arbitrate; no additional fix subagent required for this slice pass |
| `manual` | Closure audit and bookkeeping pass for slices 1–3 | 3 | Closure Audit | Completed; created `slices_1_3_closure_audit.md`, removed stale unresolved marker from `slice_2_refinery.md`, and mapped all non-implemented items to explicit follow-up phases | Closure audit introduces explicit post-commit phase `Closure Audit` for future slices as well |
| `019c4458-b5c5-7bd3-9c7e-82b427d6ca36` | Research brief for Slice 4 (ReAct + operational affordances) | 4 | Research | Completed; produced `slice_4_research.md` with V4 requirement inventory and repo-grounded gap analysis | Amended post-review to mark `U48` as `[MODIFY]` because current `forward_all` requires a fourth `display_progress` arg versus spec’s 3-arg ergonomic surface |
| `019c445d-861f-7d93-b2af-28bdcfb3e3da` | Stupidly implementable plan for Slice 4 (ReAct + operational affordances) | 4 | Plan | Failed/no output | Subagent prompt was blocked by policy guard before execution; replacing with narrower prompt |

| `019c4475-b295-75b0-8b03-ecfd11932e5f` | Adversarial review against ground truth for Slice 4 | 4 | Adversarial Review | Completed; produced `slice_4_review.md` with one high and one medium finding | High: ReAct missing `Facet` derivation/discoverability. Medium: ReAct loop prompt formatting bypasses adapter building blocks |
| `019c4478-d3ef-76b1-98e9-cbf5f4d127ec` | Apply agreed Slice 4 arbitrate fix (ReAct Facet discoverability) | 4 | Arbitrate | Completed; added `facet::Facet` derive on `ReAct` and skipped non-discoverable fields (`tools`, `max_steps`) while keeping predictor fields discoverable | Verified by `cargo check -p dspy-rs`, then re-ran targeted tests and Slice 4 smoke successfully |
| `manual` | ReAct DSPy parity pass (single call surface + trajectory smoke evidence) | 4 | Implement → Smoke Test | Completed; removed public `call_with_trajectory`, kept trajectory in normal `Predicted` metadata, upgraded deterministic test to multi-tool calculator loop, and replaced smoke with GPT-5.2 calculator trajectory proof | `cargo test -p dspy-rs --test test_module_forward_all --test test_module_ext --test test_react_builder` and `cargo run -p dspy-rs --example 93-smoke-slice4-react-operational` passed |
| `019c4536-e461-7792-ad3e-3c1115103a7a` | Research brief for Slice 5 (optimizer interface) | 5 | Research | Completed; created `slice_5_research.md` with V5 requirement inventory, existing optimizer/discovery surfaces, and [EXISTS]/[MODIFY]/[NEW] gaps for `DynPredictor` + walker migration |

## Decisions & Architectural Notes
<!-- Log every non-obvious decision, especially cross-slice implications -->
- **State transition (2026-02-10):** Advanced workflow to `Slice 5 / Research` after 4.5-lite completion; V5 is now the active slice.
- **Slice 5 research arbitration (2026-02-10):** Accepted `slice_5_research.md` as implementation baseline. Locked V5 to struct-field walker recursion with explicit container errors (per N18 + S5 deferral), and carried forward the U50 API ambiguity (`metric` arg in breadboard vs current `Evaluator`-bound compile trait) into planning for explicit resolution.
- **Calling convention revision (2026-02-09):** Replaced `CallOutcome<O>` with `Result<Predicted<O>, PredictError>` for typed module calls. `Predicted<O>` implements `Deref<Target = O>` for direct field access and carries `CallMetadata` (like DSPy's `Prediction`). Rationale: `CallOutcome` required `.into_result()?` on stable Rust, violating P1 ergonomics. Nightly `try_trait_v2` has no stabilization timeline. `Predicted<O>` + `Result` gives DSPy-parity ergonomics on stable: `module.call(input).await?.answer`. Canonical user entrypoint is `Module::call`; module authors implement `forward` as the hook.
- **Interpretation note:** historical entries below may still reference `CallOutcome` because they log pre-revision milestones. Treat those references as superseded unless an entry explicitly says otherwise.
- **Phase 4.5-lite completion (2026-02-10):** Exit gates passed. `cargo check -p dspy-rs`, `cargo check -p dspy-rs --examples`, and `cargo test` are green after C1/C5/C6 execution.
- **C1 implementation closeout (2026-02-10):** `Module::Input`/`Output` bounds now require `BamlType + for<'a> Facet<'a> + Send + Sync`, and combinator output bounds were tightened to match.
- **Facet safety correction (2026-02-10):** Replaced unsound shape aliasing on legacy `Example`/`Prediction` with derive-based Facet metadata so layout/type metadata stays truthful while data-heavy fields remain skipped/opaque.
- **C5 implementation closeout (2026-02-10):** Signature derive now emits clean helper names (`{Name}Input`, `{Name}Output`, `{Name}All`) and constructor helpers so users do not initialize phantom fields in literals.
- **C6 implementation closeout (2026-02-10):** `ChainOfThought.predictor`, `ReAct.action`, and `ReAct.extract` are Facet-transparent, while non-parameter ReAct fields remain skipped. Added shape traversal coverage in `crates/dspy-rs/tests/test_module_facet_shapes.rs` (CoT, ReAct, Map nesting).
- **C6 implementation note (2026-02-10):** `Map`/`AndThen` keep explicit `unsafe Facet` impls with skipped `facet::Opaque<F>` closure fields because current derive behavior imposes `F: Facet` for these generic wrappers.
- **Roadmap revision (2026-02-09):** Descoped Phase 4.5 to "4.5-lite" (prerequisites only). C1 (Module bounds), C5 (macro naming), C6 (Facet annotations) are in scope. C3 (optimizer ABI) and C4 (evaluator adapter) reclassified as V5 feature work. C2 (legacy quarantine) replaced by post-V6 kill pass (straight deletion, no intermediate scaffolding). Rationale: building compatibility wrappers for a system about to be replaced is waste. Full C1-C8 arbitration outcomes recorded in `phase_4_5_cleanup_kickoff.md`.
- **C1 arbitration (2026-02-09):** Accept option A (hard tighten now). `Module` bounds go to `BamlType + Facet` without compatibility wrappers. Legacy `Module<Input=Example, Output=Prediction>` impls stay on old types until kill pass.
- **C2 arbitration (2026-02-09):** Skip quarantine entirely. Legacy surfaces frozen in place until kill pass after V5+V6.
- **C3 arbitration (2026-02-09):** Reclassified as V5 scope. Optimizer ABI migration is the V5 slice definition.
- **C4 arbitration (2026-02-09):** Reclassified as V5 scope. Typed evaluator surface replaces legacy `Evaluator` trait.
- **C5 arbitration (2026-02-09):** Accept option B (redesign). Fix macro naming (`QAOutput` not `__QAOutput`) and phantom construction ergonomics.
- **C6 arbitration (2026-02-09):** Accept option B (full matrix). Fix `#[facet(opaque)]` on predictor fields; add walker traversal shape tests.
- **C7 arbitration (2026-02-09):** Accept option A (defer to V5). Error-path contract tests land when the walker exists.
- **C8 arbitration (2026-02-09):** Accept option B (lock strategy). Annotation-first with optional trace inference. Recorded for V6 planning.
- **State normalization (2026-02-09):** Tracker advanced from stale `Slice 3 / Done` to `Slice 4 / Research` per closure-audit transition rule (slice < 4 advances to next slice research).
- **ReAct DSPy parity arbitration (2026-02-09):** Removed separate trajectory call API from `ReAct` to keep a single call surface aligned with `F4` and DSPy reference behavior (`call` returns prediction while trajectory is part of returned data). Trajectory is now emitted through existing call metadata (`tool_executions`) and printed in smoke/tests without introducing another call path. Superseded return wrapper: `CallOutcome` -> `Result<Predicted<...>, PredictError>` per the calling convention revision.
- **ReAct calculator smoke proof (2026-02-09):** Updated `93-smoke-slice4-react-operational` to exercise multi-tool calculator flow (`add` → `multiply` → `add` → `finish`) and print step-by-step trajectory from metadata; real-model smoke on `openai:gpt-5.2` passed with `tool_calls: 3`, `tool_executions: 5`, `answer: 70`.
- **Slice 4 research arbitration (2026-02-09):** Reclassified `U48` from `[EXISTS]` to `[MODIFY]` in `slice_4_research.md`; batching semantics are present, but API shape currently requires `display_progress` and does not match breadboard’s 3-arg `forward_all(&module, inputs, concurrency)`.
- **Slice 4 plan review (2026-02-09):** Accepted high-level sequencing (U48 surface alignment → U51 combinators → U14 ReAct + tests), but flagged two areas for refinery against code/spec: (1) exact Facet strategy for closure-bearing wrappers (`Map`/`AndThen`), and (2) concrete plain-function tool adapter surface for ReAct builder.
- **Slice 4 refinery arbitration (2026-02-09):** Resolved `and_then` metadata ambiguity by locking `ModuleExt::and_then` to a fallible transform signature `Fn(Output) -> Result<T, CallOutcomeErrorKind>` that preserves inner call metadata; removed stale `NEEDS ARBITRATION` marker from `slice_4.md`.
- **Slice 4 smoke test (2026-02-09):** Real LM call passed end-to-end via `cargo run -p dspy-rs --example 93-smoke-slice4-react-operational` (loaded `.env`, model `openai:gpt-5.2`), returning `answer: smoke-ok`.
- **Slice 4 arbitrate (2026-02-09):** Agreed with high finding on ReAct Facet discoverability and fixed in `modules/react.rs`. Re-ran compile/tests and smoke after fix; smoke now reports `tool_executions: 1`, `answer: smoke-ok`.
- **Slice 4 arbitrate (2026-02-09):** Disagreed with medium finding (“ReAct bypasses adapter building blocks”) for this slice: both action/extract calls execute through `Predict::call` → `ChatAdapter` pipeline (`N8/F7`). The hand-built `trajectory` string is module orchestration state, not a replacement parsing/formatting pipeline; no immediate correctness gap observed in tests/smoke.
- **Slice 4 implementation (2026-02-09):** Added `ReAct<S>` module (`modules/react.rs`) with plain async tool builder (`.tool(name, desc, fn)`), action/extract loop over typed `Predict` leaves, and Facet discoverability on the wrapper struct.
- **Slice 4 implementation (2026-02-09):** Added operational affordances: new 3-arg `forward_all(&module, inputs, concurrency)` surface, `forward_all_with_progress` compatibility helper, and `ModuleExt::{map,and_then}` wrappers in `core/module_ext.rs`.
- **Slice 4 validation (2026-02-09):** `cargo check -p dspy-rs`, `cargo check -p dspy-rs --examples`, and targeted tests (`test_module_forward_all`, `test_module_ext`, `test_react_builder`, `test_chain_of_thought_swap`) passed.
- **Slice 4 smoke test (post-fix, 2026-02-09):** `cargo run -p dspy-rs --example 93-smoke-slice4-react-operational` against `openai:gpt-5.2` passed (`tool_executions: 1`, `answer: smoke-ok`).
- **Slice 4 commit (2026-02-09):** Change `nluquynv` / `d768449f` — \"slice4: implement react and operational affordances\".
- **Slice 4 closure audit (2026-02-09):** Added `docs/plans/modules/slices_closure_audit.md` with `V4` requirement accounting and consolidated deferred ledger routing. Because slice = 4, workflow advanced to Post-Implementation Cleanup.
- **Post-Implementation Cleanup (2026-02-09):** Resolved `U29` by deriving `facet::Facet` on `ChainOfThought` (`crates/dspy-rs/src/modules/chain_of_thought.rs`) and revalidated targeted module tests/smokes.
- **Post-Implementation Cleanup (2026-02-09):** Resolved `build_system` API/spec mismatch by aligning spec docs to the implemented fallible surface (`Result<String>`) in `breadboard.md` and `design_reference.md`.
- **Post-Implementation Cleanup (2026-02-09):** Ran full workspace validation (`cargo test`) successfully after cleanup edits.
- Slice definitions for this execution are V1-V3 from `/Users/darin/src/personal/DSRs/docs/specs/modules/breadboard.md` (V1 Typed call, V2 Augmentation + CoT, V3 Module authoring).
- Ground truth hierarchy for arbitration is: breadboard + shapes + design_reference + spikes S1-S8.
- **Superseded lock (2026-02-09):** N8/typed call default return was `CallOutcome<O>` (metadata-first) with `call_with_meta` folded into `call`. Superseded the same day by the calling convention revision to `Result<Predicted<O>, PredictError>` with `Module::call` as canonical and `forward` as implementation hook.
- **Calling convention constraint (updated):** single return type + single convention. `Module::call` returns `Result<Predicted<O>, PredictError>` and delegates to `forward`; no parallel convenience call path.
- **Error payload constraint:** errors must carry call metadata context (raw response/usage/field parse detail) in the same default return flow.
- **Plan review decision (2026-02-09):** Slice 1 plan must align with S1/S6 Option C replacement direction; broad legacy compatibility strategy in draft plan requires refinery correction or explicit arbitration.
- **Arbitration (2026-02-09): Flatten alias/constraint semantics.** `SignatureSchema` enforces unique LM-visible names per side (input/output). Collisions after flatten are hard errors with path detail. Constraints/format metadata are attached to flattened emitted leaf paths.
- **Superseded arbitration (2026-02-09): `CallOutcome` ergonomics.** Prior plan considered `Try`/`FromResidual` on nightly (`try_trait_v2`) with `into_result()`. Superseded by `Result<Predicted<...>, PredictError>` on stable.
- **Implementation decision (2026-02-09):** Keep minimal optimizer file edits in `optimizer/gepa.rs` and `optimizer/mipro.rs` because they were mechanical call-site adaptations required by typed module invocation; no optimizer behavior changes were introduced.
- **Adversarial arbitration (2026-02-09):** Accepted high-severity review finding on legacy flatten marker mismatch. Fixed by (1) emitting `FieldSchema::lm_name` keys in `schema_fields_to_value`, and (2) updating `FIELD_HEADER_PATTERN` to parse non-`\w` marker names (including dotted aliases/paths).
- **Smoke test (2026-02-09):** Real LM call passed end-to-end using `cargo run -p dspy-rs --example _slice1_smoke` with `.env` `OPENAI_API_KEY` and model `openai:gpt-5.2`; typed path returned expected `answer = "smoke-ok"`.
- **Arbitration result (2026-02-09):** Agreed with the single review finding and fixed it in-place (`predict.rs` legacy field-key mapping and `chat.rs` header regex). Post-fix test suite and smoke run passed.
- **Slice 1 commit (2026-02-09):** `rkuwmrtq` / `229404b5` — "slice1: implement typed call with SignatureSchema and CallOutcome".
- **Slice 2 plan review (2026-02-09):** Draft plan needs refinery arbitration on augmentation trait signatures, wrapper mutability contract (`Deref` vs `DerefMut`), and ChainOfThought public constructor ergonomics to match breadboard U13 and S3/S7 decisions.
- **Slice 2 arbitration (2026-02-09):** Resolved `ChainOfThought` API to provide `new()` (U13) plus delegated full builder DSL (`demos`/`instruction`/`tools`) via `ChainOfThoughtBuilder`, and locked augmentation wrappers to `Deref`-only (no `DerefMut`) per S3.
- **Slice 2 implementation (2026-02-09):** `WithReasoning<O>` now derives `facet::Facet` directly and implements `BamlSchema` manually (instead of `#[BamlType]`) to avoid HRTB conflicts in the macro expansion while preserving `BamlType` via blanket impl.
- **Slice 2 implementation (2026-02-09):** Adapter formatting uses relaxed path lookup to handle `#[facet(flatten)]` outputs whose BamlValue serialization flattens fields while parsing still expects nested paths.
- **Slice 2 smoke test (2026-02-09):** Real LM calls passed end-to-end against `openai:gpt-5.2` via named examples: `cargo run -p dspy-rs --example 90-smoke-slice1-typed-predict` (`answer = smoke-ok`) and `cargo run -p dspy-rs --example 91-smoke-slice2-chain-of-thought` (`answer = smoke-ok`, reasoning populated).
- **Slice 2 arbitrate (2026-02-09):** Accepted finding on legacy optimizer visibility and fixed by exposing `predictor` through `ChainOfThought::parameters()`. Re-ran Slice 2 smoke test after fix; still passes (`answer = smoke-ok`).
- **Slice 2 arbitrate (2026-02-09):** Deferred review findings on `Facet` derivation and typed module-call contract as cross-slice architectural alignment work; current Slice 2 deliverable remains consistent with the existing `Module` trait contract introduced in Slice 1.
- **Slice 2 commit (2026-02-09):** `owmrznzo` / `748368c8` — "slice2: implement augmentation + chain-of-thought module".
- **Slice 3 research (2026-02-09):** Accepted recommendation that V3 requires completing F4/F12 (typed `Module` surface + generic/flatten signature authoring) and exposing schema-driven adapter building blocks; this is a high-blast-radius migration that must preserve `CallOutcome` metadata semantics.
- **Slice 3 plan review (2026-02-09):** Accepted high-level sequencing (schema/derive → trait migration → adapter surface → module updates → tests), but flagged concrete type/API drift in the draft plan (non-existent symbols like `ChatMessage`/`schema_from_signature`, incorrect import ownership for `BamlType`). Refine against ground truth before implementation.
- **Slice 3 refinery arbitration (2026-02-09):** Refined plan passed fidelity/shape/breadboard/sequencing/API/over-engineering checks and explicit test-comprehensiveness review, but implementation will use in-repo symbols as source of truth where plan text still references speculative names.
- **Process note (2026-02-09):** Planning subagent prompts must explicitly require grounding in the repository (current code paths/patterns), in addition to the research doc and tracker decisions, to avoid speculative API names.
- **Slice 3 implementation (2026-02-09):** Completed typed module-authoring migration across core and examples: `Module` now uses associated `Input`/`Output`, `forward_all` free helper is used for batching, generic signature derive supports flatten with generated helper structs + Facet/BamlSchema plumbing, and schema-first adapter helpers are exposed for system/input/output formatting and parse paths.
- **Slice 3 implementation (2026-02-09):** Migrated examples to the new authoring syntax (`CallOutcome` handling, removed `call_with_meta`, replaced member `.batch(...)` with `forward_all(...)`) and added labeled smoke example `crates/dspy-rs/examples/92-smoke-slice3-module-authoring.rs`.
- **Slice 3 validation (2026-02-09):** `cargo check -p dspy-rs -p dsrs_macros`, `cargo test -p dsrs_macros --tests`, `cargo test -p dspy-rs --lib --tests`, and `cargo check -p dspy-rs --examples` all pass.
- **Slice 3 smoke test (2026-02-09):** Loaded `.env` and ran labeled real-model smokes against `openai:gpt-5.2`: `90-smoke-slice1-typed-predict`, `91-smoke-slice2-chain-of-thought`, and `92-smoke-slice3-module-authoring`; all returned `answer: smoke-ok`.
- **Slice 3 arbitration (2026-02-09):** Review finding on `__phantom` public leakage is stale after current implementation (`__phantom` is private). Other findings (Option-C full legacy removal, strict typed bounds on `Module`, and `build_system` fallibility) are recorded as intentional scope/compatibility tradeoffs for Slice 3 and deferred for explicit future architectural decision.
- **Slice 3 commit (2026-02-09):** Change `strkwqpy` — "slice3: implement module authoring syntax and schema helpers".
- **Process decision (2026-02-09):** Add explicit phase `Closure Audit` after `Commit` and before `Done` for slices that complete implementation. The phase output is a requirements ledger that marks each in-scope item as Implemented / Partially Implemented / Deferred with evidence and a named follow-up phase.
- **Closure audit result (2026-02-09):** `docs/plans/modules/slices_1_3_closure_audit.md` is the source of truth for slices 1–3 accounting. Summary: V1 implemented; V2 partially implemented (U29 deferred); V3 partially implemented (typed-bound/generic-hardening + legacy-cutover deferrals).
- **Deferral mapping (2026-02-09):** Assigned explicit follow-up phases: `Phase 4.5 Cleanup / API Surface Pass` (typed module bounds + generic helper contract + phantom ergonomics + `build_system` API/spec reconciliation + legacy cutover prep/removal) and `V5 Implement` (Facet walker discoverability for module wrappers).
- **Planning update (2026-02-09):** Consolidated deferred cleanup items into an explicit **Phase 4.5: Cleanup / API Surface Pass**. This phase is now the canonical destination for strict typed module bounds, macro helper generic/ergonomic cleanup, adapter surface reconciliation, and legacy API cutover prep/removal.

## Stumbling Blocks
<!-- Things that were confusing, ambiguous, or required judgment calls -->
- Existing tracker lacked `Current State` fields from the required template; normalized before continuing to avoid ambiguous phase transitions.
- Initial research draft mixed Slice 1 scope with Slice 2/5 artifacts (augmentation and DynPredictor migration). Corrected to keep Slice 1 deliverables focused on V1 call path while preserving cross-slice constraints.
- Implementation subagent introduced unexpected edits outside assigned ownership (`optimizer/gepa.rs`, `optimizer/mipro.rs`) while attempting to satisfy compile ripple effects from `Module` return type changes.
- `cargo check -p dspy-rs --examples` initially failed after the module trait migration due stale example syntax (`call_with_meta`, untyped `Module` impls, member `.batch(...)`). Resolved by updating all impacted examples and adding a Slice 3 smoke example.
- Slice 2 planning subagent produced no deliverable (`slice_2.md` missing) and had to be replaced.
- Slice 2 adversarial review subagent took longer than expected; waited through multiple polls before completion.
- Slice 3 research confirms V3 is not incremental polish: it requires trait-shape migration across core module/predictor surfaces and may ripple into optimizer and examples.

## Open Questions
<!-- Unresolved issues to revisit -->
- `Post-Implementation Cleanup` remaining scope: strict typed `Module` bounds, generic-helper/`__phantom` ergonomics, and Option-C legacy-surface cutover (`MetaSignature`/`LegacyPredict`) are still large migrations with broad compatibility impact.
- `V5 Implement`: complete walker discoverability for wrapper/combinator module trees as the canonical replacement for legacy `Optimizable` traversal.
- Untyped `Example`/`Prediction` example policy and evaluator/feedback migration boundary are clarified in the kickoff doc; execution remains open under C2/C3/C4 gates.
- Decision matrix and sequencing for cleanup kickoff are now centralized in `docs/plans/modules/phase_4_5_cleanup_kickoff.md`.
