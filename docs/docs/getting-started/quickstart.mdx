This guide will walk you through setting up your Rust project and building your first LM pipeline in DSRs.
The entire process takes a few minutes and requires only basic Rust 
knowledge. The goal in this quickstart demo is to get you up and running configuring your LM in DSRs,
define a signature, run a prediction, and see the results. Let's go! üöÄ


<Steps>
<Step title="Install DSRs">

You can add DSRs to your project just like any other Rust crate, using either of these two methods:

**Option 1: Add to Cargo.toml**
```toml
[dependencies]
anyhow = "1.0.99"
dspy-rs = "0.5.0"
serde = "1.0.221"
serde_json = "1.0.145"
tokio = "1.47.1"
```

**Option 2: Add via Cargo command**
```bash
cargo add dspy-rs anyhow serde serde_json tokio
```

This will create an alias `dsrs` for the `dspy-rs` crate which is the intended way to use it.

<Note>
We need to install DSRS using the name `dspy-rs` for now, because
`dsrs` is an already-published crate.
This may change in the future if the `dsrs` crate name is donated back or becomes available.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Set up your language model">

The first step in DSRs is to configure your Language Model (LM). DSRs supports
any LM supported via the `async-openai` crate. You can define your LM
configuration using the builder pattern as follows.

Once the LM instance is created, pass it to the configure function along with
a chat adapter to set the global LM and adapter for your application.
`ChatAdapter` is the default adapter in DSRs and is responsible for converting
the instructions and the structure from your signature (defined in the next step)
into a prompt that the LM can follow to complete the task.

```rust
use dspy_rs::{configure, ChatAdapter, LM, LMConfig};
use std::env;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
    // Define a config for the LM
    let config = LMConfig::builder()
        .model("gpt-4.1-nano".to_string())
        .build();
    // Create the LM instance via the async builder
    let lm = LM::builder()
        .config(config)
        .api_key(env::var("OPENAI_API_KEY")?.into())
        .build()
        .await;
    // Configure the global LM and adapter
    configure(lm, ChatAdapter::default());

    Ok(())
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Define task via signatures">

A signature defines the structure of your task: what inputs it takes and what outputs it should produce. Think of it as a schema for your LM call,

You can create your signature in DSRs in one of two ways: using an inline macro, and via an attribute macro.

Let's create a question-answering signature using the inline macro:

```rust
let signature = sign! {
    (question: String) -> answer: String
};
```
The input fields are to the left of the `->` arrow, and the output fields are to the right. Multiple fields can be comma-separated, for e.g., `(question: String,
context: String) -> answer: String`.

Alternatively, you can have more control over defining more granular aspects of the signature by defining signature using attribute macro on structs.

```rust
#[Signature]
struct QASignature {
    /// Answer the question concisely.

    #[input(desc="Question to be answered.")]
    pub question: String,

    #[output]
    pub answer: String,
}
```

The advantage of the latter approach is that you can add doc comments at the 
top of the struct, specifying
important domain information or specific instructions to the LM.
Additionally, you can also annotate each field with `#[input]` and `#[output]`
attributes, useful when you have multiple input and output fields, and when
you want to add descriptions to each field.

</Step>

<Step title="Create a simple predictor">

A predictor is the simplest module in DSRs. It takes a signature and input data, and orchestrates the LM call to produce a prediction. Let's demonstrate this
with an example.

Gravity was explained by Isaac Newton in 1687. To make this more interesting,
let's ask the LM to answer in Renaissance-era English! We can do this by asking
for this explicitly in the signature doc comment.

LM calls in DSRs are asynchronous and return a future, so we need to use the `tokio` runtime to execute a function that uses a predictor.

```rust
use dspy_rs::{
    ChatAdapter, Example, LM, LMConfig, Predict, Predictor, Signature, configure, hashmap,
};
use std::env;

#[Signature]
struct QA {
    /// Use Renaissance-era English to answer the question.

    #[input]
    pub question: String,

    #[output]
    pub answer: String,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
    let config = LMConfig::builder().model("gpt-4.1-nano".to_string()).build();

    let lm = LM::builder()
        .config(config)
        .api_key(env::var("OPENAI_API_KEY")?.into())
        .build()
        .await;

    configure(lm.clone(), ChatAdapter::default());
    // Create a question-answering signature instance
    let signature = QA::new();
    // Create a predictor
    let predictor = Predict::new(signature);
    // Define the question
    let question = "What is gravity?";
    // Create an example input to the predictor
    let inputs = Example::new(
        hashmap! {
            "question".to_string() => question.to_string().into()
        },
        vec!["question".to_string()],
        vec!["answer".to_string()],
    );

    let result = predictor.forward(inputs).await?;
    println!("Answer: {:?}", result.get("answer", None).as_str().unwrap());
    Ok(())
}
```

The predictor takes an `Example` as input, which is a mapping from field names to values. The following result is obtained.

Result:

```txt
Answer: "Gravity, good sir or madam, is the unseen force that draweth all things
unto the center of the Earth, binding the celestial spheres and ensuring that
objects fall when cast down. It is the natural power ordained by the divine
hand to keep the heavens in their orbits and men grounded upon the earth."
```

There we go. You can imagine that as being explained by Isaac Newton himself! üßê

</Step>

<Step title="Build modules for complex pipelines">
Predictors are the simples module calls in DSRs. You can also compose together
a more complex module that wraps a predictor and your own forwards calls.

```rust
use dspy_rs::{
    ChatAdapter, Example, LM, LMConfig, Module, Predict, Prediction, Predictor, Signature,
    configure, hashmap,
};
use std::env;

struct AnswerQuestion {
    inner: Predict,
}

impl AnswerQuestion {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            inner: Predict::new(QA::new()),
        }
    }
}

impl Module for AnswerQuestion {
    async fn forward(&self, inputs: Example) -> anyhow::Result<Prediction> {
        self.inner.forward(inputs).await
    }
}
```
You can define an implementation of the `Module` trait for your own struct that
composes together one or more predictors and your own arbitrary logic. In this case, the `AnswerQuestion` module wraps a predictor that uses the `QA` signature defined earlier.
The forward method is async because it wraps a predictor call.

We can define the main function to use this module as follows.

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let config = LMConfig::builder()
        .model("gpt-4.1-nano".to_string())
        .build();

    let lm: LM = LM::builder()
        .config(config)
        .api_key(env::var("OPENAI_API_KEY")?.into())
        .build()
        .await;

    configure(lm, ChatAdapter::default());
    // Create the module instance
    let module = AnswerQuestion::new();
    // Define the question
    let question = "What is gravity?";
    // Create an example input to the module
    let inputs = Example::new(
        hashmap! {
            "question".to_string() => question.to_string().into()
        },
        vec!["question".to_string()],
        vec!["answer".to_string()],
    );
    
    let result = module.forward(inputs).await?;
    println!("Answer: {:?}", result.get("answer", None).as_str().unwrap());
    Ok(())
}
```
This produces a similar result.

```
Answer: "Gravity is the divine force, as understood by the wise of the
Renaissance, that draweth all things towards the center of the Earth, binding
the heavens and the earth in a harmonious embrace. It is the unseen hand that
keeps the celestial bodies in their courses and the objects upon the ground
in their place."
```

This is just the tip of the iceberg. DSRs supports many more features, including
an Optimizable trait for modules that can help improve your modules via
optimizers. Continue exploring the rest of the documentation to learn more!
